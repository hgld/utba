## What do I do if I see a swarm ?

Relax, swarms are a perfectly natural part of the honeybee lifecycle. While they may seem intimidating they are not an emergency for you or the honeybee. If you do nothing, the bees will likely move on to their new home within 2 days.

If you'd like us to re-home a swarm that you've located please email us info@urbantorontobeekeepers.com

* Please take a photo of the swarm (in focus please)
* Describe where the swarm is located (30 ft up a tree, in a garbage bin, on a fence)
* Physical location (close major intersection)
* Date when swarm first noticed
* Your contact information (cell phone or email)

Swarms usually occur between May and early July. If you are seeing flying black and yellow insects in the fall coming out of a  crevice or hole this is not a swarm and may not even be a honeybee.
