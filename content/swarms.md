**Honeybee Swarms**

You’ve found what you think is a honeybee swarm, let’s make sure.

Swarms usually occur on warm sunny days from May to July.

Below are some photos of honeybee swarms. The honeybees are clustered, there is no nest material (wax comb) underneath the honeybees.

If honeybees have decided to make a home on/in your house or shed they will begin to build honeycomb in which they store honey, pollen and immature bees. Honeybees do not live in the ground or in paper or mud nests.

**What should I do if I see a swarm?**

A honeybee swarm is a natural part of the honeybee colony lifecycle and is not usually an emergency. In most cases the honeybees will move on in a day or two.

Don’t approach the swarm. Although typically honeybees are docile there is always a risk of being stung. Observe from a distance.

Contact the UTBA to have a honeybee swarm relocated.
