## What do I do if I see a swarm ?

Relax, swarms are a perfectly natural part of the honeybee lifecycle. 

Swarms usually occur between May and early July 

Please take a photo of the swarm (in focus please) 

Describe where the swarm is located (30 ft up a tree, in a garbage bin, on a fence) 

Physical location (close major intersection) 

Date when swarm first noticed

Contact information (cell phone or email) 

Add 'this is not a bee'
