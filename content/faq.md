**Frequently asked questions**

**Why should I pay for a mentorship?**

_One- to-one mentoring offers a unique coaching experience without requiring the mentee to commit to months of labour in a mentor’s beeyard in exchange for learning and experience._

  
**What happens if I miss a meeting?**

_Except in an emergency, a mentee is expected to show up at agreed dates and times. The mentor will not be expected to make up missed sessions. A mentor who misses meetings will be removed from the registry and UTBA will work to provide another mentor._

**What happens if the weather does not cooperate?**

_This is often an issue in beekeeping and both parties need to be flexible. Rain dates should be agreed between mentors and mentees._

**Do I need to have my own hives?**

_No, a mentor can teach you in their apiary and get you ready and comfortable to manage your own hives. However, it is preferable to have your hives while you are a mentee in order to apply what you have learned._

**How much should I know beforehand?**

_To get the most out of your mentorship training, you are strongly advised to learn as much as possible ahead of time. There are many online resources, courses, and books, some of which are listed on our UTBA website. Individual mentors may agree to take on a beekeeper with limited prior knowledge. Please read mentor profiles to determine best fit._

**Where can I find beehive courses or classes?**

_Visit UTBA or OBA websites._

**What does communicating in a timely manner (48 hours) mean?**

_Sometimes life gets more hectic than we anticipate. Letting other people know that we received their message but that we might need some time to respond properly allows that person to know communication is still good. This is very important in creating a successful mentorship program._

**If I pay for the course, can I bring my beekeeping friend, or a friend who just wants to watch or a family member or my children?**

_No. The course is intended for the one person who paid for the course._

**What if I don’t get along with my mentor/mentee?**

_The mentor co-ordinator will endeavour to resolve any issues that arise from conflicting relationships._
