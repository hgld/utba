Introduction to the UTBA Mentorship Program

the program consists of a minimum of 7 mentoring sessions throughout the beekeeping season between an experienced UTBA beekeeper/mentor and one to three new beekeepers eager to get some hands-on beekeeping practice and knowledge. The mentorship sessions will take place either in the mentorâ€™s beeyard/apiary or at the hives owned by the new beekeeper (mentee).

We hope that this hands-on approach will give new beekeepers the confidence they need to successfully manage their own apiaries, pursue beekeeping over the long term and perhaps even become mentors themselves.

We have established some guidelines for the roles and [responsibilities](/mentorship-guidelines/) of mentors and mentees. This is a work-in-progress document that will improve over time as we learn from our mentorship experiences

.The mentor program endeavours to match all mentees based on availability of mentors.

Please read our  guidelines for the roles and responsibilities of mentors and mentees before you  apply.
