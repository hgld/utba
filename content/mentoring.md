**Urban Toronto Beekeepers’ Association Mentorship Program**

The UTBA has been planning to initiate a Mentorship Program in 2020, intended to pair new beekeepers with experienced mentors. As planned, this program would involve a number of face-to-face interactions throughout the beekeeping season and hands-on beekeeping either at the apiary of a mentor or the new beekeeper.

Unfortunately, Covid-19 has made that plan impossible, at least for the early months of the 2020 beekeeping season. We are currently working on an alternative, which would allow experienced beekeepers to mentor new beekeepers by other means.

We will be posting mentor profiles soon, so that interested new beekeepers can learn more about potential mentors.

If you are interested in mentorship in 2020, keep an eye on this page.

We hope to be announcing a modified program soon.

The program,  described below,  will be available when social distancing rules are relaxed by our Provincial and Municipal governments.

The program consists of a minimum of 7 mentoring sessions throughout the beekeeping season between an experienced UTBA beekeeper/mentor and one to three new beekeepers eager to get some hands-on beekeeping practice and knowledge. The mentorship sessions will take place either in the mentor’s beeyard/apiary or at the hives owned by the new beekeeper (mentee).

We hope that this hands-on approach will give new beekeepers the confidence they need to successfully manage their own apiaries, pursue beekeeping over the long term and perhaps even become mentors themselves.

We have established some [guidelines](/mentorship-guidelines/) for the roles and responsibilities of mentors and mentees. This is a work-in-progress document that will improve over time as we learn from our mentorship experiences

.The mentor program endeavours to match all mentees based on availability of mentors.

Please read our  [guidelines](/mentorship-guidelines/) for the roles and responsibilities of mentors and mentees before you  apply.

**Mentees will contact the mentor directly through their profile as you will develop your own relationship directly with the mentor.**

Mentorship Program cost:

$350 per person for a group of 2 to 3 people

$500 for a one-on-one experience

A non-refundable deposit of $100 is to be paid directly to the mentor to secure your spot. The balance is due to the mentor on the first visit.

$50 from each mentee fee goes to the UTBA

Taxes included.

I have been learning beekeeping for the past dozen years. I got my training working with the Toronto Beekeeping Co-op \[ Collective\]. I was Co-chair of the Co-op for two years then my partner Fran Freeman and I opened our own bee yards. We currently manage three Toronto sites at Humber College and the Humber Arboretum. We also offer a year long beekeeping course through the Arboretum. We have given many presentations to schools and other organizations and for three years ran a summer bee education program at a YMCA camp where we also helped establish and run their own bee yard. As well as the city bee yards I have a few hives in the Niagara area. I have also been mentoring a new beekeeper there. My beekeeping philosophy is based on a covenant by Mark Winston in his book "Bee Time"

" _We the bees will provide you with honey as well as other products of the hive as well as pollinator services.In return, you the beekeeper will provide an environment in which we can thrive, free of toxic pesticides and rich in diverse flowering plants_."

I would also add that I respect the bees' need for their own supply of honey and use only organic treatments.
