**Urban Toronto Beekeepersâ€™ Association Mentorship Program**

The UTBA has been planning to initiate a Mentorship Program in 2020, intended to pair new beekeepers with experienced mentors. As planned, this program would involve a number of face-to-face interactions throughout the beekeeping season and hands-on beekeeping either at the apiary of a mentor or the new beekeeper.

Unfortunately, Covid-19 has made that plan impossible, at least for the early months of the 2020 beekeeping season. We are currently working on an alternative, which would allow experienced beekeepers to mentor new beekeepers by other means.
