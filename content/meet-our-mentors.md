I have been learning beekeeping for the past dozen years. I got my training working with the Toronto Beekeeping Co-op \[ Collective\]. I was Co-chair of the Co-op for two years then my partner Fran Freeman and I opened our own bee yards. We currently manage three Toronto sites at Humber College and the Humber Arboretum. We also offer a year long beekeeping course through the Arboretum. We have given many presentations to schools and other organizations and for three years ran a summer bee education program at a YMCA camp where we also helped establish and run their own bee yard. As well as the city bee yards I have a few hives in the Niagara area. I have also been mentoring a new beekeeper there. My beekeeping philosophy is based on a covenant by Mark Winston in his book "Bee Time"

" _We the bees will provide you with honey as well as other products of the hive as well as pollinator services.In return, you the beekeeper will provide an environment in which we can thrive, free of toxic pesticides and rich in diverse flowering plants_."

I would also add that I respect the bees' need for their own supply of honey and use only organic treatments.
