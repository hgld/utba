● Coach and model good record keeping

● Respond to mentee questions or concerns in a timely manner (within 48 hours)

● Provide feedback (positive and negative) to the mentor coordinator

● Mentors agree to prepare a mentor profile that outlines their style/philosophy of beekeeping; their preference to teach in their own or the mentee’s apiary; the rough location of the mentor’s hives; the maximum number of participants in a group; the approximate dates of mentorship sessions; accessibility; and willingness to take on a mentee with no prior experience or beekeeping study

● All mentors must be approved by the Mentorship committee prior to posting mentorship profiles
