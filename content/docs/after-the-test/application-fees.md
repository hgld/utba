The visa and immigration fees are reviewed at regular intervals. You should always check what the fee is before you submit your application. If you submit an application with the incorrect fee then it will be rejected. The fees for visa applications can be found on the GOV.uk website on their [UK visa fees](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/visa-regulations-revised-table) page. If you are applying for citizenship you should check the [Fees for citizenship applications](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/fees-for-citizenship-applications) of the GOV.uk website. You can only pay for British citizenship applications with a cheque in sterling from a UK bank account, or with a credit or debit card. If you are applying for Settlement, also known as Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR) your application fee depends on the form you are completing. You should check the [Settle in the UK](https://www.gov.uk/browse/visas-immigration/settle-in-the-uk) page for information about your type of application .
