This section offers information about how to apply for British citizenship.

Completing your citizenship application
---------------------------------------

All the information you need to submit your application for British citizenship should be available from the [GOV.uk website](https://www.gov.uk/becoming-a-british-citizen). This page will explain the requirements and provide links to the documents you need. Most applications for naturalisation use the Form AN. You can download a copy of Form AN, along with guidance documents, from the [GOV.uk website](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/application-to-naturalise-as-a-british-citizen-form-an). You can also find more information on the [Citizenship and living in the UK](https://www.gov.uk/browse/citizenship/citizenship) page of the GOV.uk website. If your application is non-standard then check [Types of British nationality](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality) page. Be careful that you correctly submit your application. It is not possible to get a refund for incorrect applications. Thousands of citizenship applications are rejected each year for reasons that could have easily been avoided. Check the [Guidance on completing form AN](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/318570/2902467-Guide_AN_v1_0.pdf) to ensure you fill your application form correctly.

Submitting your citizenship application
---------------------------------------

There are two ways that you can submit your application:

*   make an individual application
*   use an agent or representative

If you make an individual application you must complete Form AN and submit it along with the correct supporting documentation and fees. When you apply for citizenship you’ll usually be referred to UK Visa and Citizenship Application Services (UKVCAS) as part of the application process. When you attend an appointment with UKVCAS you will provide:

*   your biometric information (fingerprints and photo)
*   supporting documents for your application.

##Waiting Times

You can get the latest expected waiting times from the [Waiting times](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/uk-visas-and-immigration/about/about-our-services) page of the GOV.uk website. The Home Office advises that you should not to make any non-urgent travel arrangements until your passport or travel documents have been returned.
