Applying For Your Passport
==========================

Now that you are officially a British citizen, you can [apply for a British passport](https://www.gov.uk/apply-first-adult-passport). Applying for a new passport used to be a relatively simple matter. However, the increase in passport fraud and identity theft has meant that there are more checks to process new applications. The Identity and Passport Service (IPS) have introduced interviews for all first-time applicants for a British passport. The interview is to verify your identity by getting you to confirm details about your background and past history. The IPS recommend that you allow at least 6 weeks for your passport application to be processed.Â  This means you should not book any travel until you have attended the interview and received your passport. Details about booking an interview will be sent to you after your application has been received by HM Passport Office. The interview should take 30 minutes and is free of charge. Before sending your application, make sure your photographs comply with biometric regulations. There are strict guidelines for photographs and it is recommended that you visit an experienced passport photo retailer to have your photograph taken. More information, including the latest fees and guidance on the photos and documents you must provide, can be found on the [Apply for your first adult passport](https://www.gov.uk/apply-first-adult-passport/fees-and-how-to-pay) page of the GOV.uk website.
