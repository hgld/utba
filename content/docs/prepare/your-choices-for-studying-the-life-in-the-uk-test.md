The material that has to be learnt for the Life in the UK test is determined and provided by the Home Office. It produces a publication called _Life in the United Kingdom: A guide for new residents_. You are required to learn all of the information found in this publication for your test. The publication has a recommended retail price of £12.99. The material provided by the Home Office is lengthy and complex. As an alternative, Red Squirrel Publishing provides a wide range of products and services to help you learn for your test. These products and services have been developed and designed by us with one goal in mind: to help you pass your test first time.

The series includes the Life in the UK Test: Study Guide (RRP £9.99) and the Life in the UK Test: Study Guide & CD ROM (RRP £12.99), which let you recreate the test at home with hundreds of practice questions. The Handbook and Study Guides contain the complete testable material found in the official Home Office publication, _Life in the UK: A guide for new residents,_ reprinted in full. They also include study tools to make it easier for you learn this information:

*   chapter introductions that summarise each chapter’s content, highlighting the information you should be paying close attention to.
*   trusted advice and an FAQ based on questions from people who have successfully passed the test
*   tips and warnings, to make learning easier and help you avoid common mistakes
*   a calendar of the key dates in the text, and an extensive glossary of words and terms to help you understand anything you are unsure about

We also offer the Life in the UK Test: Practice Questions (RRP £6.99). This publication contains twenty practice tests, which are in the same style as the Life in the UK test.
