Arrange valid photographic ID and supporting documents
------------------------------------------------------

The staff at test centres turn lots of people away because of problems with their registered photographic ID and supporting documents. Make sure you read our [guidance on registering your ID](http://lifeintheuk.wpengine.com/?page_id=129). Your proof of address must be an original document - no photocopies - and no more than 3 months old. Remember, mobile phone bills are not acceptable proof of address. Your ID can be one of the following documents:

*   a Biometric Residence Permit: This is a residence permit which holds your biometric information, facial image and fingerprints - this document must be in date
*   a passport from your country of origin – this document may be out of date
*   a UK photocard driving licence, full or provisional - this document must be in date
*   one of the following Home Office travel documents: a Convention Travel Document (CTD), a Certificate of Identity Document (CID) or a Stateless Persons’ Document (SPD) – this document must be in date
*   an Immigration Status Document, endorsed with a UK Residence Permit and bearing a photo of the holder - this document may be out of date, or
*   a European Union Identity Card - this document must be in date

* * *

Test centre location and travel route confirmed

Make sure you note your test centre address and phone number and have planned your travel arrangements for getting to the test centre.

Pass the test and celebrate!
