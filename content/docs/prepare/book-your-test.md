If you are ready to take your Life in the UK test then you must register with the Life in the UK Test online booking service. You will have to provide various pieces of information before you can book. You will also have to pay in advance. The Life in the UK Test is managed on behalf of the Home Office by Ufi Limited, a not-for-profit organisation that specialises in on-line testing and assessment. The test is conducted at over 30 Life in the UK Test Centres across the UK. If you are ready to book your test then read the information below to help you understand the process.

Create an account online
------------------------

You must first of all [register for the Life in the UK account](https://www.lituktestbooking.co.uk/lituk-web/) before you can choose the most convenient test session and pay for the test.

Minimum one week waiting time
-----------------------------

Make sure you plan your study carefully. You will have to wait at least one week from the date that you book your test before you can take your test. You can use the new system to book as many tests as you like, but you can only book them for the person named on the account. You must pay for each one when you book it. Your test fee will not be refunded if you cancel your booking less than seven days before your test.

What do I need to register?
---------------------------

When you register your account you will need to provide various pieces of information. This information must be accurate as if they do not match the information you bring on the day of your test you may be refused entry and will not be given a refund. The information you must provide when registering is:

*   Your name
*   Your date of birth
*   Your country of birth
*   Your nationality
*   Your place of birth
*   Your method of ID (this must be in date unless this is a passport or an immigration status document)

You can change these details up to 7 days before the date of your test by logging in to your account on the [Life in the UK Test booking website](https://www.lituktestbooking.co.uk/lituk-web/).

What happens when I get to the test centre?
-------------------------------------------

You must bring the ID you used when registering your account to the test centre on the day of your test. If you arrive with a different ID you will not be allowed to take your test. Your ID will be checked to ensure that:

*   The photo is a true likeness of you
*   It is in date, where required
*   It matches the details you provided when you registered

You will be able to take a practice test two times before you start the real thing. The results of this test will not affect the result of your real test. You will also be allowed to take notes but they must be handed over to the test supervisor before you leave the room. The test supervisor will destroy your notes. As with the old system, if you pass then you will get a pass notification letter which should be signed and stamped by a test supervisor. **You will not be able to get a replacement if you lose the letter**. You should contact the Home Office if you do lose the letter.

Test centre information
-----------------------

You will be given the details of your nearest test centres when you register an account.
