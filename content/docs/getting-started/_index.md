#### Raring to go?   What do you need to be an urban beekeeper? 

You'll need to:

* Have a place to keep your bees and understand how to choose a good spot
* Learn about beekeeping equipment, different hives styles and protective equipment 
* Understand how to protect yourself from stings through the use of protective equipment, smoke, timing and gentle frame handling technique
* Learn about the roles and functions of the queen, workers and drones
* Understand the honeybee lifecycle and how it impacts colony population management
* Interpret colony health through frame inspection 
* Learn how to protect honeybee health by identifying pests and recognizing symptoms of disease and creating an integrated pest management plan 
* Recognize the value of inspection goals and good record keeping
* Understand the process of nectar collection, ripening and honey extraction 
* Be able to prepare your colonies for winter 

So how do you get to where you need to be?  We recommend a combination of textbooks, videos, classes, hands on practice and mentoring. Joining a local beekeeping can connect you to all of these things.
