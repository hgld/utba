  * Rusty is I am a master beekeeper with degrees in agronomic crop science and environmental studies. My approach to beekeeping is based on peer-reviewed science, logical thinking, experimentation, discussion, and experience. The work of thousands of scientists and beekeepers has contributed to my understanding of bees, and to them I am immensely grateful. [Honeybee Suite](https://www.honeybeesuite.com)
