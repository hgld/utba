**Essential Books for the Beekeeper**

Every beekeeper should have a basic book or two to give them essential background on the art and science of beekeeping, and to consult when questions come up. Some of the best we have found, especially for the beginner beekeeper, include:

· **_Natural Beekeeping: Organic Approaches to Modern Apiculture_**_, 2nd_ Edition by Ross Conrad (2013)

· **_The Backyard Beekeeper_**_, 4th Edition_ by Kim Flottum (2018)

· **_Beekeeping for Dummies_**_, 4th Edition_ by Howland Blackiston (2019)

· **_The Beekeepers’ Handbook_**_, 4th Edition_ by Diana Sammataro and Alphonse Avitabile (2011)

For a more in-depth look at bee biology, consider a book that is widely used as a textbook in North American beekeeping courses, and keep it as a reference guide:

· **_Honey Bee Biology and Beekeeping_**_,_ by Dewey M. Caron with Lawrence John Connor (2013)
