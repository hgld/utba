The study materials for the Life in the UK test contain all the information you need to pass the citizenship test. However hard you try, it is very difficult to give a complete and representative picture of British society in under 200 pages. The official study materials, _Life in the United Kingdom: A Guide for New Residents_, cover complicated topics and simplify things. Because of the amount of information covered this is inevitable, so readers must bear in mind the purpose of the test – for instance the differences between the terms ‘road tax’ and ‘vehicle excise duty’ aren’t significant. However, there are some issues with the text that need to be highlighted. You will find them highlighted in our study materials with blue underlining. The following information is intended to clarify points that may be confusing. The page numbers given refer to our Handbook, Study Guide and Study Guide and CD ROM titles.

**The official advice from the government always has been, ‘learn the material as reproduced in the book for your test’.**
